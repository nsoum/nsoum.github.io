<title>Private Tutoring</title>
<body><br>
I have tutored the following subjects at Penn : Math 312, 240, 241.<br>
(I will not be tutoring students in Math 312 this semester, Fall 2012.)<br><br>
I am also available for tutoring other math subjects at the undergraduate level.<br><br>
I charge 40 $/hour. If you and some friends would like to be tutored simultaneously, then you may add 25 $ to the total for every additional person.<br>
Please email me if you would like to set up an appointment.<br>
