<title>Private Tutoring</title>
<body><br>
NOTE : If you are currently enrolled in a class in which I am a teaching assistant or instructor, I cannot tutor you. <br><br>
I have tutored the following subjects at Penn : Math 103, 104, 114, 240, 241, 312.<br>
I am also available for tutoring other math subjects at the undergraduate level.<br><br>
I charge 60 $/hour. If you and some friends would like to be tutored simultaneously, then you may add 30 $ to the total for every additional person.<br>
Please email me if you would like to set up an appointment.<br>
